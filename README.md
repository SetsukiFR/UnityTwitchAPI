Description
---
This small library allows for easy and quick integration of Twitch API in your Unity game.

The goal is to provide all the required tools to easily and quickly integrate Twitch API commands.

It handles **Twitch Authentication**, has a Simple Request Library to **easily add API commands**, and is provided with a set of existing libraries to simplify the process, including **listening to Chat**.

**Poll** and **Announcements** API commands are already integrated as examples.

Use the **Examples.cs** file for a complete Twitch integration in a few lines.
